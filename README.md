# About  

[thunar-sendto-clamtk](https://gitlab.com/dave_m/thunar-sendto-clamtk) is a simple plugin to allow a right-click, context menu scan of files or folders in Thunar, XFCE's file manager.

All this plugin does is copy a desktop file to Thunar's send-to directory.  If this seems redundant, that's because it is: this plugin depends on clamtk, which already has this directory file. So, it stands to reason we should be able to just find that file and copy it, rather than having our own copy.

[thunar-sendto-clamtk](https://gitlab.com/dave_m/thunar-sendto-clamtk) is available for Fedora, CentOS (and its derivatives), and Debian/ Ubuntu - or probably any system that can run XFCE.  It is also now available via Fedora's official repositories.
