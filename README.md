# About  

[thunar-sendto-clamtk](https://github.com/dave-theunsub/thunar-sendto-clamtk) is a simple plugin to allow a right-click, context menu scan of files or folders in Thunar, XFCE's file manager.

All this plugin does is copy a desktop file to Thunar's send-to directory.  This provides the ability to right-click on a file or folder/directory to scan it directly, without opening the virus scanner first.

[thunar-sendto-clamtk](https://gitlab.com/dave_m/thunar-sendto-clamtk) is available for Fedora, CentOS (and its derivatives), and Debian/ Ubuntu - or probably any system that can run XFCE.  It is also now available via Fedora's official repositories.
